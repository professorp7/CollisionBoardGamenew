I want to build a web-based companion app to help manage all my custom characters and battles. This will not be a full game, but a tool to help me and others play, track, and manage battles in my custom game system.

✏️ I want to be in full control:
I will add the characters myself (not preloaded ones).

I will type in and edit their stats, abilities, and passives.

I want to use this app so I don’t have to print paper or keep rewriting stuff.

✅ Main Features I Need:
1. Character Editor
A section where I can:

Create new characters.

Give each character a name.

Set their stats:

HP

Speed

AC

Initiative

Add and remove abilities (up to 7 per character).

Each ability can include:

Name

Description

Damage

Range

Special effects

Mark certain abilities as (Passive).

2. Character List / Browser
A way to browse all saved characters.

Click on a character to:

View their full sheet (stats + abilities).

Edit them anytime.

Delete characters if I need to.

Optional: Tag or sort characters by type (e.g. “Ghost”, “Mario”, “Tank”, etc.)

3. Team Builder
A section where I can:

Pick characters from the character list to add to a team.

Create and name custom teams.

View and save the teams I build.

Optional: Let each team be 3–6 characters (or any number I want).

4. Battle Tracker
Once I pick a team, I want to enter a battle layout:

Each team member has:

HP tracker (click +/– or type in)

Status condition tracker (e.g. stunned, poisoned — can type them in)

Turn order number

The opponent team also has their side of the battlefield with the same features.

It should be easy to update during play.

5. Dice Roller
A built-in tool where I can roll common dice:

d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20

Press a button to roll the dice, and it shows the result instantly.

Optional: Add multiple dice (like 2d6 or 1d4 + 1d8).

🛠️ What I’m Using This For:
To keep track of character HP, turns, and statuses in real-time during battle.

To build and customize all my characters for my own custom game system.

To have a super easy way to track battles without paper or printing.

To make it easier to play with friends and always have the characters ready.
